title: About me
---

In 2004 I graduated from the Moscow State University. For a long time I worked on problems related to computational linguistics and artificial intelligence. While working at ABBYY, I took part in the development of Compreno natural language processing technology. Then he was one of the developers of the Alice voice assistant (Yandex company). In recent years, within Yandex Media Services, I have been leading the technology development service, which focuses on tasks related to the analysis and processing of media content (music, movies, podcasts).

List of my publications is available [here](https://www.zotero.org/{{site.zotero_username|cgi_escape|escape}}).
